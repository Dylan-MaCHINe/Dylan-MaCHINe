- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dylan-MaCHINe

- ðŸ‘€ I have recently acquired an interest in the cloud space, and have been immediately hooked by this immersive concept. After 5 years in the Marine Corps as an Intelligence Analyst, it was finally time to
choose a new career path

- ðŸŒ± So far I have learned AWS Cloud fundamentals, Bash and Python scripting, IaC (namely Terraform) with a few projects incorporating various AWS services. I am currently learning CI/CD with plans of putting together a simple project that will incorporate everything I've learned
